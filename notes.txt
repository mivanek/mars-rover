A couple of notes regarding my implementation of the test:

I've seperated the code into 4 files: main.rb, cli.rb, rover.rb and map.rb.
I've also included 2 other files, cli_automatic.rb and main_automatic.rb, which
can be used for any automated testing. I've explained the difference between
the files and their *_automatic.rb versions in the *_automatic.rb files. In the
spec/ folder, you can also find a couple of RSpec tests for the assignment.

To run the program, you can execute:

    ruby main.rb

    or

    ruby main_automatic.rb

main.rb is simply a file that requires cli.rb and then executes the
MarsRoverCLI class, which handles user interaction with the program.
main_automatic.rb is basically the same, but it includes cli_automatic.rb
instead of cli.rb

cli.rb handles user interaction with the app. It prompts users for input, and
handles calling all the necessary methods to move the rover and checks for any
collisions using the MarsMap class. The first prompt asks the user to input the
number of the rovers, and every prompt after that handles map size, rover
location and rover movement information, as described in the assigned task. For
any automated inputs, there's cli_automatic.rb which removes prompting the user
for the number of rovers and uses an infinite loop to create and move rovers
over the map.

rover.rb handles rover movement and orientation. It's a pretty simple class
with only a couple of methods. The main methods for this class are move, which
handles movement of the rover, and turn, which handles rover heading.
